## Description about this project:

This project is a simple profile search page on github.

## Main decisions:

I decided to use React Router 6 or more, because I think that new versions are more simple than the others versions.
I decided to create a hooks for Query and fetch, because I want to show that I know to use hooks. ðŸ™ƒ
I decided to use Styled Components for the same reason.
As much as it is a small project, I preferred to architect the components folders and others, with an index.js to export their functions.
I prefer to use JavaScript with propsTypes than TypeScript, but I also work with TypeScript.
I have developed this project on a computer without access Github, so this project don't have commits.
